# Innovation coming with "V3"
* New control interfaces have been added on Android. **(JOYSTICK, VR)**
* Camera moved on 2 axes **(JOYSTICK AND VR INTERFACES)**
* Added new RC Vehicle support **(Added steering wheel control software with servo motor.)**
* The Windows application was developed. Fly Joystick was used to control the vehicle.
* VR support added **(2 axes movement of camera according to head movements)**.<br>
**NOTE:** When VR mode is selected, a second device is required for motion control of the vehicle. Likewise, a second android phone can be used with the help of other control interfaces or with the aid of a Fly joystick on a Windows PC.<br>
